Write down the impulse response of the echo in a room that has non-zero components as mentioned in table below: Note that the impulse response of the echo is zero everywhere else. Determine the echo generated in the room for the ‘solo.wav’ file. Make use of the sparsity of the echo impulse response to achieve computational efficiency. Do NOT use MATLAB ’conv’.

Components of the echo:

| Time instant | Impulse response amplitude (linear scale) |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 10 ms        | 0.65                                       |
| 30 ms        | -0.25                                      |
| 60 ms        | 0.05                                       |
| 80 ms        | -0.05                                      |

API Specification:

1. Function name : echo_response

2. Inputs/Arguments to the function should be: x (a column vector)

3. Output of the function should be a column vector y : echo output

4. The function should be callable as: [y] = echo_response(x)
